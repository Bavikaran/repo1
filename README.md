User Input: It prompts the user to choose an operation and input two numbers.
Operation Execution: Based on the selected operation, the corresponding arithmetic operation is performed.
Division Handling: If division is chosen, the program checks for division by zero to avoid errors.
Result Display: The result of the chosen operation is displayed on the console.
Error Handling: An error message is shown if the user selects an invalid operation or tries to divide by zero.
